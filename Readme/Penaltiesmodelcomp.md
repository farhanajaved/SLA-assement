In this example Solidity code, the "TraditionalModel" is a smart contract that simply penalizes users linearly based on the number of breaches they've had. For each breach, the contract imposes a fixed penalty of `0.1 ether`.

Here is how the penalty is calculated in the traditional model:

```solidity
function calculatePenalty(address user) public view returns (uint256) {
    return breaches[user] * 0.1 ether;
}
```

This is a straightforward, linear penalty scheme where the penalty grows directly proportional to the number of breaches (`breaches[user]`). For example, if a user has 3 breaches, the penalty would be `0.3 ether`.

This serves as the "Traditional Model" in your example, contrasting with the "Hybrid Model", which combines a Quadratic Penalty and a History-Based Penalty to calculate a more complex, nuanced penalty.
